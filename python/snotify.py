# Intended use:
#
# play a soundfile when a message comes in (for choosable buffers)
#
# TODO: implement playing a soundfile when a highlight occurs
# TODO: (possibly) show the number of unread private messages and
#       highlights in status bar
# TODO: Find out, why sometimes "w.hook_process" doesn't seem to
#       start (or at least no sound is being played)
# TODO: (possibly) Change app-choosing to some predefined options (like
#       mplayer, vlc or ogg123, etc...)
# TODO: Make the whole script more Python-like (if I find out how...)
# TODO: Make the script not beep on message from yourself

# History:
#	2010-10-17: version 0.1: initial release
#
#  2010-10-17: version 0.1.1:
#     * change: If a buffer + sound is added and psound is empty, then
#                psound is set to given sound
#     * fix: bugs in "on"- and "off"-functions
#     * fix: "on"- and "off"-statusses were not used
#  2010-11-15: Version 0.1.3
#		* change: No sound is played anymore on messages from yourself.
#		* fix: a new sound for an entry already in the list wasn't set.
#		* change: Replaced "weechat.hook_process" with Pythons' "subprocess.Popen"

"""
* in places where you can enter a buffername, its best to use the 'Tab'-key
  to cycle through available buffers. If no buffer is chosen at all or the
  buffer doesn't exist, the current buffer will be used.
* You are free to choose whatever player you want (by entering its' name. I
  urge you to *not* enter any command that could be dangerous, as the
  command will be executed just as if it were entered on the commandline.
  The suggestion for common players would be 'mplayer', 'vlc' or 'ogg123';
  without the quotes of course).
  
Available options are:
- player:  The application used to play a soundfile
- psound:  The soundfile that should be played
- buffers: The saved buffers (it's best to not edit that setting directly.
  Rather choose one of the above mentioned commands).
  
Commands:
- test:      Test soundplaying with current settings
- add:       add/edit a buffer. If no sound is chosen, the standard on is being
             used (if one is set)
- remove:    Remove a buffer.
- off:       Turn off sound for buffer
- on:        Turn on sound for buffer
- muteall:   Turn off sounds for all buffers
- demuteall: Turn on sounds for all buffers that were activated before
- list:      List all saved buffers""",
